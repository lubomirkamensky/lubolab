      <description>The Idea There are many situations when you miss a delivery or a visitor while being in the garden, garage, workshop or just watching a movie or listening music.
Of course, there are wireless doorbell extenders, but I prefer system solution.
The idea is simple, to integrate the standard wired doorbell into my sensor network so each doorbell ring generates MQTT message as any other sensor.
Then there are unlimited options how to utilize the doorbell events.</description>

      <description>The Motivation I am definitely not a hardware guy. Never was and never will be, but nevertheless, I enjoy building my smart house and garden.
I started with not that smart weather station and moved its data to the cloud in my first blog and later used some open API of smart IoT products like Netatmo Cameras, see the article here.
Unfortunately, there are some limitations always. It is hard to customize the specialized products and mostly it is only possible to access the data from the cloud.</description>
