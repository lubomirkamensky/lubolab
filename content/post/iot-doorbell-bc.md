### The Idea
There are many situations when you miss a delivery or a visitor while being in the the garden, garage, workshop or just watching a movie or listening music.

Of course, there are wireless doorbell extenders, but I prefer robust system solution :)

The idea is simple, to integrate the standard wired doorbell into  my sensor network so each doorbell ring generates MQTT message as any other sensor.

Then there are unlimited options how to utilize the doorbell events. And we can easily test them using a simple Node-RED flows. To send a SMS, to activate some light effect on a LED strip or sound on an external alarm.

### The Solution
Well, the success of any solution depends on the ability to find the best solver for the task. And in this case I was absolutely positive I am not the one. So I raised my question on [BigClown forum](https://forum.bigclown.com/t/how-to-connect-standard-wired-doorbell-into-bigclown-ecosystem). 

I am not sure what I really expected but I got more than dreamed of. Not only perfect solution for this one task but also good understanding of several electronic components and in overall big motivation to cope with similar challenges in future.
